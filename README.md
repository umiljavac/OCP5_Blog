# OCP5_Blog
### Project number 5 of OpenClassrooms "Developpeur d'application PHP / Symfony" cursus.
The aim of the project is to create a simple blog where everybody can add, update and delete contents.  
Except for the Bootstrap theme [Freelancer](https://bit.ly/2emOTxY), and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), there's no other library or framework used here.  
### Download
Just click on **`Clone or download`** green button of this repository. 
### Installation 
Make your web server pointing to the **Web** directory inside the **OCP5_Blog** directory.  
Create your Database with the **OCP5_blog.sql** file contained in **OCP5_Blog/Config/sql** directory.  
It's almost done but you may have to adjust the `Data Source Name`, `username` or `password` of your PDO instance.  
So, if needed, go to **OCP5_Blog/Lib/Main/PDOFactory.php** and configure your connection.  
  
That's all ! I think..
